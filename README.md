Two key purposes of this repository are:

* To use the associated [Wiki](https://github.com/digitalabs/Documentation/wiki) for general help documentation on various topics such as development collaboration, installation, deployment, configuration, development and other technical help topics.
* To use the associated [Issue Tracking System](https://github.com/IntegratedBreedingPlatform/Documentation/issues) as a common place for tracking bugs/enhancements/features etc. raised by development teams (other than Leafnode - Team Leafnode still uses the internal JIRA system.) contributing to BMS code base.

For the BMS User Manual see [the IBP Website](https://www.integratedbreeding.net/62/training/bms-user-manual).
